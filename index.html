        <p>The approval of a loan depends on a system of awarded scores, as follows:</p>
        <p>1.If your current account balance is more than the required loan amount, you will be awarded a score of +10</p>
        <p>Otherwise if it is less, a score of -10 would be awarded.</p>
        <p>2.If there is a six months credit history you'd be awarded a score of +10.</p>
        <p>3.If your last deposit is within a month a score of +5 would be awarded. </p>
        <p>4.If your last loan collection date is above six months, a score of +10 would be awarded.</p>
        <p>5.If your loan repayment period is within six months, a score of +10 would be awarded.</p>
        <p>6.If your account type is 'Current' a score of +10 would be awarded, and if it is 'savings' a score of +5 would be awarded.</p>
        <p>Therefore the loan can only be granted if your score point is above 30.</p>
